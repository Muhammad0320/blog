  Na'am next time when you're trying to teach me something, please just go for the "more modern and robost" approach
  Now, I have a hunch that the there's something wrong with either the ts config file or my own folder structure - 
  because when my include was "include: ["src"]". I see this error: src/data/controller/post.controllers.ts:76:26 - error TS2339: Property 'postId' does not exist on type 'Request<ParamsDictionary, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>'.

76       const postId = req.postId as number;
  But when I did something like this: "include: ["src/**/*"]" I saw a different error instead: TSError: тип Unable to compile TypeScript:
src/data/middleware/validation.middleware.ts:23:7 - error TS2339: Property 'postId' does not exist on type 'Request<ParamsDictionary, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>'.

23   req.postId = id;

And I thought nodemon restarts the terminal whenever I save any, but not it doesn't do anything unless it's the tsconfig file.

I really don't know what's happening.
The summary: I don't think ts compiler saw the changes in my express.d.ts file, because I gives me the same error when I did global declaration, though no error appears in the ide (it doesn't have to)
so take your time to really see what's happeing

It doesn't work still, Is it because of the package.json file? it looks like this: {
  "name": "blog",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon src/app.ts"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "devDependencies": {
    ....
  },
  "dependencies": {
      ....
  }
}
